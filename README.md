# odin-recipes
Hey hey! This is the second Odin Repo I've created, and I guess, my first Odin Project. 

In this particular project, I will showcase some HTML skills I've learned:
- basic HTML elements and tags
- different text styles
- lists
- links and images

This is going to be a very bare bones project, at least to start, until I get further along. 

Alright! CSS has been added!
