# odin-recipes
Hey hey! This is the second Odin Repo I've created, and I guess, my first Odin Project. 

In this particular project, I will showcase some HTML and CSS skills I've learned in the course:
- basic HTML elements and tags
- different text styles
- lists
- links and images
- margins, padding, borders
- height and width
- fonts and color
- background
- display types
- probably some other stuff too, but it's late and I don't feel like digging through notes atm


This is going to be a very bare bones project, at least to start, until I get further along. 

Alright! CSS has been added!
