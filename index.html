            Welcome to my first Odin project! The purpose of this site is to 
            simply showcase what I have learned in the course thus far. So far, that includes 
            HTML and some basic CSS mainly around margins, padding, borders, fonts and the 
            two dimensions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is currently the second iteration of the site, where we showcase some of the 
            aforementioned CSS skills we learned. I'm not sure yet if we'll be revisiting this 
            project or not. If we don't, I may come back to it when I have more interesting 
            ideas for a design for the site. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mean time, make yourself at home and have a look around! And then check black
            at a later date to see if anything's changed. See you then!
