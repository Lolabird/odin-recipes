            Welcome to my first Odin project! The purpose of this site is to 
            simply showcase what I have learned in the course thus far. Which is just
            some HTML stuff. So at the moment it looks a bit of a hot mess. Please excuse it lol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accoring to the site, we should be revisiting this bare bones site
            after learning more CSS, so it won't look like this forever. Unless, of
            course I get shiny object syndrome, which has been known to happen, more
            often than I care to admit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At any rate, make yourself at home and have a look around! And then we'll see
            if in few weeks' or months' time if I've continued with the project.
