            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, I'm a millenial and yes I love me some avocado toast.
                Bite me. :p What I love even more, though, is just how versatile
                this dish is. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Avocado toast can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.
                Sometimes, I just want just the bread and avacado. Other times, I'm
                gormet it up, taking as much as a half hour to get my toast ready!
            </p>
            <p>This recipe will focus on the basics, but you can do up your avocado
                toast however you want to. 
            </p>
            <p>And with that in mind, let's get to it!</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One medium to large avocado</li>
                <li>A couple slices of nice quality bread</li>
                <li>Butter or olive oil</li>
                <li>Optional toppings and condiments of your choosing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Heat up some butter or olive oil in a pan.</li>
            <li>Soak up that melted butter or oil with the bread.</li>
            <li>Toast it. Now you have a few options here:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can leave it in the pan and let it toast that way, or/li>
                        <li>You can remove the bread and toast in an oven or toaster.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Personally, I prefer letting my bread toast on the stove on medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>While your bread toasts, slice up your avocado. I know some 
                    people like to smush the avocado to hell. If you're one of those
                    people, more power to you, but I'm not about that life. If I
                    wanted guacamole, then I'd make that... properly --- but you do you. ;)
                    Also, <strong>keep an eye your toast!</strong> Toasty bread has a
                    way of sneaking up on you.
            </li>
            <li>Add the avocado to your toasty bread and enjoy! <em>Ooorr...</em></li>
            <li>Gourmet it up and add some of your favorite toppings to it.
                    I personally enjoy fresh greens, roasted tomato, cheese, mustard,
                    and sometimes the occasional fried egg and hot sauce - but that's
                    getting into sandwich territory lol.
            </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Anyway, I have blabbed enough. Go off and enjoy your avocado toast my 
                fellow "entitled" millenial! I know I'm going to enjoy mine!
            </p>
